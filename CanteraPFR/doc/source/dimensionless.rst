Dimensionless Numbers
=====================

When dealing with reactor models, it is always useful to be able to quickly
compute approximate dimensionless numbers for the studied case. In what follows
we provide a brief description of theses quantities as implemented in this
package. Definitions might vary according to the author or field of application
and here we follow uniquely [Ref.2]_.
